# Harvard Business Review (HBR) Style Visualization

Create sophisticated, editorial-style data visualizations and infographics in the signature style of the Harvard Business Review.

## Overview

This skill enables the creation of high-impact, professional visualizations that emulate the distinct editorial and academic aesthetic of the Harvard Business Review. The focus is on intellectual density, strategic clarity, and a sophisticated design that balances complex information with clean, readable layouts. The output is intended for academic presentations, managerial reports, and strategic documents that require authority and elegance.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Strategic Framing (Mandatory)

Every visualization must be built around a central argument or insight. It should not merely present data, but interpret it.

**Requirements:**
- The visualization must be anchored by a strong, declarative headline that states the core finding.
- Every element should support this central argument.
- Sidebars or callouts like "Key Takeaways" or "Managerial Implications" should be used to distill actionable insights.

**Bad Example:** "Market Share of GenAI Video Models"
**Good Example:** "While Incumbents Lead in Technical Specs, New Entrants Are Winning on Developer Experience and API-First Integration"

### 2. Visual & Design Standards

#### Aesthetic
- **Editorial & Academic:** Clean, structured, and intellectually dense.
- **Sophisticated:** A masterful balance of whitespace and content.
- **Authoritative:** Minimalist but impactful, designed for credibility.

#### Typography
- **Titles & Headlines:** **Slab Serif** (e.g., Rockwell, Roboto Slab, Zilla Slab).
  - Weight: Bold or Semi-Bold.
  - Color: Charcoal Grey `#333333` or Black `#000000`.
- **Body Text & Annotations:** **Classic Serif** (e.g., Garamond, Caslon, Libre Baskerville).
  - Weight: Regular.
  - Color: Charcoal Grey `#333333`.
- **Data Labels & Sidebar Text:** **Sans-Serif** (e.g., Helvetica, Arial, Inter) for clarity at smaller sizes.
  - Weight: Regular or Medium.
  - Color: Medium Grey `#666666`.

#### Color Palette
- **Background:** Light Cream `#FDFBF7` or Pure White `#FFFFFF`.
- **Primary Text:** Charcoal Grey `#333333`.
- **Primary Accent (for key data, lines, highlights):** **HBR Signature Crimson Red** `#A6192E`.
- **Secondary Accents (for comparison or less emphasis):**
  - Medium Grey: `#666666`
  - Light Grey (for borders, dividers, gridlines): `#D9D9D9`

#### Layout
- **Central Framework:** Often features a prominent conceptual model (e.g., flywheel, 2x2 matrix, maturity model) as the centerpiece.
- **Bold Lines:** Use bold, thick lines for frameworks to give them visual weight.
- **Sidebars:** A distinct column for "Key Takeaways," "The Big Idea," or "Managerial Implications" is a signature HBR element.
- **Whitespace:** Use generous whitespace to frame content and improve readability, creating a sense of calm authority.

### 3. Aspect Ratio Standards

**CRITICAL: Always use landscape (horizontal) orientation for consistency.**

**Recommended aspect ratios:**
- **Landscape (16:9):** Default for presentation slides.
- **Landscape (3:2 or 4:3):** Suitable for embedding in documents.

## Visualization Types & Use Cases

### Type 1: The Central Conceptual Framework

**Use when:** Explaining a virtuous cycle, a maturity model, or a multi-part strategic concept.

**Elements:**
- A central, bold diagram (e.g., a circular flywheel, a 5-step pyramid, interconnected boxes).
- Uses the **HBR Crimson Red** as an accent for arrows or key components.
- Each component of the framework is clearly labeled with **Slab Serif** headings.
- Brief descriptions in **Classic Serif** body text.

**Example Prompt:** `Create a 4-step flywheel diagram illustrating the "Data Network Effect" in GenAI. The steps are: 1. Product Adoption, 2. Data Generation, 3. Model Improvement, 4. Enhanced Value Proposition. Use a bold, circular arrow flow. The style should be academic and clean, like a Harvard Business Review infographic. Use HBR's crimson red for the arrows.`

### Type 2: The Annotated Chart with Sidebar

**Use when:** Presenting data (e.g., bar chart, line chart) with detailed interpretation.

**Elements:**
- A main chart area (e.g., 70% of the width).
- A sidebar (30% of the width) with the heading "Managerial Implications" or "Key Takeaways".
- The chart uses a muted palette (greys) with the **HBR Crimson Red** to highlight the key data series or finding.
- Annotations directly on the chart point to significant data points.

**Example Prompt:** `Generate a horizontal bar chart comparing "Time to Master" for different GenAI video models. Data: Seedance (4 weeks), Kling (6 weeks), Veo (5 weeks), Luma (2 weeks). Highlight Luma's bar in HBR crimson red. To the right, add a sidebar titled "Managerial Implications" with bullet points explaining that faster onboarding is a key competitive advantage. Use a sophisticated, HBR-style editorial layout.`

### Type 3: The 2x2 Matrix

**Use when:** Positioning competitors, strategies, or ideas along two axes.

**Elements:**
- A classic four-quadrant matrix with clearly labeled axes.
- Axes and quadrant lines are clean and can be bold.
- Players or concepts are positioned as dots or logos.
- Quadrants are given strategic names (e.g., "Niche Players," "Market Leaders").
- **Slab Serif** for axis labels and quadrant titles.

**Example Prompt:** `Create a 2x2 matrix for the GenAI video market. X-axis: "Technical Capability (Low to High)". Y-axis: "Ecosystem & Usability (Low to High)". Position four players: Seedance 2.0 (High Tech, Mid Eco), Kling (Mid Tech, Mid Eco), Veo (High Tech, Low Eco), Luma (Mid Tech, High Eco). The design should be academic and minimalist, in the style of Harvard Business Review.`

## Prompt Engineering Templates

### Template 1: Central Framework

```
Create a [TYPE OF FRAMEWORK, e.g., 5-step maturity model] illustrating [CONCEPT]. The stages are: [STAGE 1], [STAGE 2], [STAGE 3], [STAGE 4], [STAGE 5]. The visual style must be a sophisticated, academic layout in the signature Harvard Business Review style. Use bold, thick lines for the framework structure and HBR's signature crimson red as the primary accent color. Typography should use a Slab-Serif for titles and a classic Serif for body text. The background should be light cream.
```

### Template 2: Annotated Chart with Sidebar

```
Generate a [CHART TYPE, e.g., line chart] showing [DATA DESCRIPTION] from [START DATE] to [END DATE]. Data points: [DATA]. The key trend/data point, [KEY DATA], should be highlighted in HBR crimson red. The layout must be a sophisticated HBR-style editorial design with a main chart area and a right-hand sidebar titled "[SIDEBAR TITLE, e.g., Key Takeaways]". The sidebar should contain the following text: "[SIDEBAR TEXT]". Use a Slab-Serif for the main title and a classic Serif for annotations.
```

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering any visualization, verify:

- [ ] **HBR Aesthetic:** Does it look like it belongs in the magazine? (Academic, clean, dense).
- [ ] **Color Palette:** Is HBR Crimson Red used as the primary accent against a cream/white background with charcoal text?
- [ ] **Typography:** Are Slab-Serifs used for titles and classic Serifs for body text?
- [ ] **Strategic Insight:** Is there a clear, insight-driven headline?
- [ ] **Layout:** Is there a good balance of content and whitespace? Is a sidebar or central framework used effectively?
- [ ] **Clarity:** Is the visualization easy to understand despite its density?
